## Introduction and description

This is the first official website for Best Alquileres, a temporary rental company based in Argentina. The client wanted to have a website where they could upload different apartments 

## Status and TBDs

Due to the client's unexpected need to launch sooner than originally planned (deadline moved to January 31st, 2021), the current version of the project fully delivers on all of the client's needs, but there's plenty of room for improvement down the road.
